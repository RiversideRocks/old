      Hello, here is some info on the "Normal Things" series. We are trying to film more episides, however,
      school is back in session.
      <br>
      This makes it a little bit more difficult to gather up the crew to film. However, we are working hard
      <br>
      and hope to release an episode in the comming weeks. Don't forget to stay subscribed with post notifications on!

      Video Game Tournaments
      <br>
      <i>10/28/19</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tournaments are a highly requested event on my channel and I enjoy hosting them (even though they are a techlogical nighmare)
      <br>
      I held a tournament a few months ago and I belive that it went well. One of the next tournaments I plan to host will be most likley
      <br>
      be minecraft. I predict that it will take place in January of February 2020, when I (hopfully) recive a better computer
      <br>
      that can support minecraft servers. Until then, stay updated with the channel by subscribing and joining my discord server!
