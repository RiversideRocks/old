# The Old Riverside Rocks Website
My old website! The good old days...

# Info/FAQ
## What are those "giberish" pages?
Those are part of the old pin login system, built in only html (and very easily "hackible" by just looking at the source.)
To log in with the pin system, you can use the code: `358`

## What is this?
This is the archive of my old website. The original one was deleted, but I thankfully saved the mobile edition. You can view it
live at [mobile-riversiderocks.glitch.me](https://mobile-riversiderocks.glitch.me)

## Where is the new website?
My new website is located at [riverside.rocks](https://www.riverside.rocks). The repo for that can be found [here](https://github.com/RiversideRocks/welcome).

Enjoy!
